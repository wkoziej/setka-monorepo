- **In Progress**: 0  
- **Remaining**: 9 core + 2 optional
- **Overall Progress**: 65.4% (17/26 core steps)
- **Chunk 5 Progress**: 100% (2/2 steps complete)

## Next Action
Continue with Step 6.1: MedusaCore Basic Structure using the prompt provided in plan.md.

But first, let's test scheduled Facebook posts functionality.

## Notes
- Each step should achieve 100% test coverage before moving to the next
- Follow TDD approach: write tests first, then implementation
- Mock all external dependencies comprehensively
- Validate against original specification continuously
- Maintain code quality and documentation standards throughout

## Dependencies Between Steps
- Steps within each chunk should be completed in order
- Some cross-chunk dependencies exist (e.g., Step 3.x depends on Step 1.x completion)
- Core orchestration (Chunk 6) requires completion of Chunks 1-5
- Integration testing (Chunk 7) requires all previous chunks

## Risk Mitigation
- Each step is small enough to be completed and tested thoroughly
- Comprehensive mocking reduces external API dependencies
- Incremental approach allows for early detection of issues
- TDD approach ensures high code quality from the start
